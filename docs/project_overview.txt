ONLINE BANKING TRANSACTION MONITORING DASHBOARD

PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to monitor online banking transactions, analyze transaction patterns, and identify high-risk transactions using data analytics and visualization techniques. The dashboard provides a consolidated, single-page view of key transaction metrics to support fraud detection and business decision-making.

BUSINESS PROBLEM
Financial institutions process a large volume of online transactions daily. Manually identifying suspicious or high-risk transactions is inefficient and prone to error. This project addresses the need for an automated monitoring solution that highlights risk patterns and abnormal transaction behavior.

DATA SOURCES
- Customer data (CSV files)
- Transaction data (CSV files)
- Data stored and managed using MySQL database

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Python: Data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering
- MySQL: Data storage, schema creation, data validation
- Power BI: Data modeling, KPI calculation, dashboard visualization
- Excel: Initial data inspection

DATA PROCESSING WORKFLOW
1. Raw customer and transaction data imported into MySQL
2. Data cleaned and processed using Python scripts
3. Risk-related features engineered (risk level, flags, frequency)
4. Analytics-ready data exported for Power BI
5. Single-page dashboard created for monitoring and analysis

KEY METRICS (KPIs)
- Total Transactions
- Total Transaction Amount
- Average Transaction Amount
- High-Risk Transactions
- High-Risk Percentage

DASHBOARD INSIGHTS
- Monthly transaction trends reveal seasonal spending patterns
- Debit transactions slightly exceed credit transactions
- Certain merchant categories contribute higher transaction volumes
- High-risk transactions are concentrated in specific months

FINAL OUTCOME
An Executive-Level Power BI dashboard designed that enables stakeholders to monitor transaction health, identify risk patterns, and support data-driven decisions.
